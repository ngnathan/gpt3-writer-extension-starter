Negative Aspects: - The organizer of the conference failed to attract attendees. - The organizer failed to cover travel and accommodation for speakers. - The organizer gaslit a lot of people who were speaking up. - The organizer acted like the whole thing went great. - The organizer should never organize an event again. - The organizer may have yielded little to no ROI.`
